# Team norms

## 1) Team values

Important agreements so that everyone knows what is expected of them in terms of responsibility.

### a) How the team will work together:
                    
- For optimal collaboration & communication, each member should attend daily Standups!
- Any communication regarding project should be on discord channel.
- Communicate!!!

### b) How members who need help will solicit it from the others:

- If any issues come up and block/prevent a member from completing their responsibilities:
    - Communicate that in Daily Standup ASAP
    - Team will discuss and see who is best suited to help
    - If no solution from team discussion, consider either altering responsibility/task or speaking with course tutor/professor

### c) How the team will resolve conflicts:
  
- If there are disagreements on direction:
    - All team members should be aware of the disagreement
    - To solve disagreement, first discuss as a team
    - If still no agreement, narrow down options and anonymous vote
- When a member is failing to deliver on their obligations to the team:
    - If it is not communicated with the team:
        - Report to professor/course assistant
        - Quickly adapt and take over their responsibility if still no change
    - If it is communicated with the team:
        - Work on solution (refer to **section b**)
- How quick should team members respond to messages directed at them:
    - Messages directed at team members should be labeled with urgency
    - Responses depend on urgency but should be no later than 12 hours

## 2) Sprint cadence

### How much time should a sprint take?

2 Weeks

## Daily standups

- Daily Standups will take place at the end of the day to report what has been done throughout the day.
- Daily Standups are for each member to discuss:
    - What I worked on today **or** What I accomplished today
    - What went wrong (if any) **or** What issues & blockers came up (if any)
    - How can I solve that (if any or if not already solved)
    - What I will work on tomorrow
- If a member has not made progress, they should:
    - Attend the Standup 
    - Communicate that in the Standup
- Standups may not always be convenient for everyone, so it can be a:
    - **Virtual Call**
    - **Message on Discord Channel** (outlining the 4 topics above)
- It is okay to be busy with other stuff and not participate once in a while, but please:
    - Do not make that a habit
    - Communicate with the team when they are busy
- Take responsibility for communicating your tasks/accomplishments/issues with the team. 
- Agreement that members will not cover for other members who do not participate.
- Agreement that a member who makes no progress on a task for two standups or more in a row will be reported to management.
- Agreed Weekly Schedule: Thursday, Saturday, Monday

## Coding standards

- Designate a code editor and code linter all team members will use to standardize code formatting.
- Don't over-engineer. Write minimum code to get things working end to end, only then iterate to improve.
  - Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed and pass tests before merging into the `main` branch of code.
- Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
- Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
- Provide descriptive commit messages.
- Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
- Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once you learn how to do that).

## Concluding thoughts

Keep this document practical and real - make it yours, not someone else's. Please don't write in things you know your team is not going to do or care about just because you see other people doing that online. Team norms reflect your team's personality and values.

# Git Workflow

- Each member should clone the project into their own local machine.
- Then, refer to [the feature branch workflow](https://knowledge.kitchen/content/courses/agile-development-and-devops/slides/feature-branch-workflow/#4)
